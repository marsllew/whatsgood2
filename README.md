This project was an attempt at making a dining services app to serve the students at the college of William & Mary better than the offerings from the current company. It was a group project with developers of varying levels of coding ability, and most code made by other students is left unaltered with the sections I was responsible for marked, While I did do bugfixing on other sections of code I generally avoided rewriting large sections of code written by other students. As well the app originally webscraped the dining service providers website to pull the dining information. Unfortunatly W&M has switched their dining service provider and our method of data collection is no longer viable. To compensate for this I hardcoded some menu options in, so that the app could still function and act as a demo while I wait for the new menu system to come completely online and change over the method of data collection.

If you want to use the app there is a default login so you don't have to enter any personal information, just put the letter a in both the username and password slot and it will login to a premade account. If you have any questions about the code please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.
